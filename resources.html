                        <h2>Learning More About Computers</h2>
                        <h3>For the Beginner</h3>
                        <p>If you are needing more tutorials on how to use your computer, <a href="https://www.seniorsguidetocomputers.com/">Senior's Guide to Computers</a> is an excellent place to start. Whether you are a senior citizen or not, the information here is well laid out and the links lead to videos that give a visual experience as well. This site is a bit dated and the tutorials were aimed at Windows 10; however, the information is still relevant and will help you understand your computer if you are running Windows 11 as well.</p>
                        <h3>For the Intermediate Learner</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://www.professormesser.com/">Professor Messer</a> is quiet possibly the most comprehensive site in learning computer skills on the internet. This site is focused to learning information that would lead to 3 IT certifications for CompTIA. These are the A+, Network+ and Security+ certifications which are gold standards in the IT world. Professor Messer teaches for the certification exams for all 3 of these. These should be learned in the order noted before and even if you don't intend to get the certifications the information you will learn will make you incredibly knowledgable.</p>

                        <h2>Keeping Up With The News</h2>
                        <h3><a href="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</a></h3>
                        <p>If you are looking for a place just to go and see what current data breaches and attacks are currently occuring, The Hacker News is a great resource. They focus directly on stories that pertain to cybersecurity. With that said the website can be very technical, so it may be overwhelming for those who are newer to learning about security. Don't worry though, focus on the data breaches and see if it affects any companies you may have accounts with. If it does, change your password and check with them to see how to best protect yourself!</p>
                        <h3><a href="https://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a></h3>
                        <p>Ars Technica is an awesome technology and science website. They have articles on a wide array of topics from gadget reviews, science findings, video games, and important for us data breaches/cyber attacks. This website is way more friendly for people who don't want to get into details, but want to know whats happening.</p>

                        <h2>Podcasts For People Who Rather Listen</h2>
                        <h3><a href="https://firewallsdontstopdragons.com/">Firewalls Don't Stop Dragons</a></h3>
                        <p>For podcasts, I will only give one recommendation and that goes to Firewalls Don't Stop Dragons by Carey Parker. You will later see I also suggest Carey's book of the same name. Carey's mission is the same as mine, but he thows in the fantasy castle metaphors to make the content fun and intersting.
                            I only think this one podcast is needed for this list, I quit listening to all other privacy and security podscasts after this one. Carey keeps you up to date with data breaches, security flaws and techniques to stay secure and private.</p>
                        <p>The podcasts are set up for an audience who may not be super techie, so he will break down complex topics and often reiterate what something may mean. This is a great place to also learn cyber security, but does lack a visual aspect. His book provides that, but it does have a cost. 
                            However, I do recommend the book if you are willing to purchase information on cyber security as it is worth it. Although my goal is to outline some of the basics of security and touch on privacy on this site with visuals for free, the book is an amazing reference especially when your focus is privacy.</p>

                        <h2>Books For Your Shelf</h2>
                        <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Windows-11-Dummies-Andy-Rathbone/dp/1119846471">Windows 11 For Dummies</a></h3>
                        <p>Never be fooled by the title of the For Dummies books. Honestly the For Dummies books do an amazing job of teaching a topic without the fluff and getting to the point. This one is no exception to this and if you need to learn Windows 11, it is worth it.</p>
                        <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mac-OS-Dummies-Bob-LeVitus/dp/0764525646">Mac OS X For Dummies</a></h3>
                        <p>Same arguement as above, but for those trying to learn Mac OS X. I have never used a Mac, but have thought about switching, and I would buy this book. I almost always start with For Dummies books and move into more intermediate learning later.</p>
                        <h3><a href="https://firewallsdontstopdragons.com/buy-the-book/">Firewalls Don't Stop Dragons</a></h3>
                        <p>I did say the book would be here. This book does an amazing job of taking complex topics and making them understandable to everyone. I love the castle and dragon references used to make the topics understandable. There are also checklists and recommendations for services to use as well as walk throughs on how to do it.</p>

                        <h2>Movies and Shows</h2>
                        <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5446858/">Zero Days</a></h3>
                        <p>This documentary discusses one of the most devastating cyberweapons named Stuxnet, how it was used, and its unforseen consequences. This documentary will show you the importance of cycersecurity as when used as a weapon the consequences can be deadly.</p>
                        <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4736550/">The Great Hack</a></h3>
                        <p>This documentary shows how your personal data can be used against you and how it can be used to manipulate for political gain. This documentary is terrifying and truly made me a bit angry seeing how privacy is much harder than security for users.</p>
                        <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/">Mr. Robot</a></h3>
                        <p>This is a bit more for entertainment than for learning, but the show is very good. You follow a cybersecurity analyst who is hacker in his off time. The show takes some crazy turns, but you can expect to hear cybersecurity vocabulary and see the world through the eyes of a hacker.</p>

                <h2>Important Note For Everybody</h2>
                <p>Keep in mind that cybersecurity should be something you learn to protect yourself and shouldn't become something you constantly fret over. Just pick a couple of resources from the above and try to stay up to date of whether your information may be at risk. 
                    Unless you are passionate about learning cybersecurity, then learn and implement what you need to keep yourself safe and then spend your time on your passions. Don't let the fear of what can happen overrun you to where you don't use technology to enrich your life.
                    Technology is a tool to make our lives better and help us spend time on the things we love, so ensure that you keep everything in perspective. If you are feeling overwhelmed, look into Cal Newport who talks about using technology as a tool and not revolving your life 
                    around it. Cal Newport has wrote and amazing book on this topic &#40;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515">Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</a>&#41;.</p>
