                    <h2>What is Digital Security in Today's World?</h2>
                    <p>In today's world most everyone is using the internet. Whether it be shopping online, playing video games, or keeping in contact with friends, we use the internet and we put our information out into a system most people don't truly understand. The internet allows us many conveniences, but also provides risks.</p>
                    <p>Digital security really is two different topics that must both be taken into account so that you can decide what fits the use case of you as an internet user and what you are most worried about.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this website is to provide basic education on the two topics of security and privacy. Then we will explore the basic ways by which you can protect yourself while using the web.</p>

                        <h2>Security</h2>
                        <p>Security should be thought of like we do a safe. Security is knowing that our personal information is safe from the hands of bad actors that may want to steal from us.</p>
                        <p>In the digital world, these theives are often called "Hackers" by the news. Often you will hear about identity fraud, password leaks, and sometimes emails from Prince's needing money who will pay you back.</p>
                        <p>We will learn how to protect ourselves from these bad actors by improving our security and awareness of their tactics.</p>

                        <h2>Privacy</h2>
                        <p>Privacy can be thought of much like closing the blinds in your house. What you are doing inside there is not the business of those outside.</p>
                        <p>When we refer to privacy in the digital world, we are referring to your ability to use the internet and remain private from other people who may be trying to see what you are doing.</p>
