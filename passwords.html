                    <h2>Security</h2>
                    <p>Improving security is the process of making your computer harder to get attacked by malware or hackers, making your data available for backup if you do get infected with malware, and keeping your online accounts safe from attackers.</p>
                    <p>In this section it will be assumed you as the user are using Windows for any demonstrations; however, if you are running MacOS there will be similar things to do to improve security as well. As I am not a MacOS user, I will not be demonstrating those, but you should look up how to set up similar settings on your system as well.</p>
                    <h3>A Note On Making Passwords</h3>
                    <p>I will often say for things you will need to create a unique and strong password. I think it is important to first talk about what a unique and strong password is so that as you go through you will be able to create these and maintain them.</p>
                    <p>The first noted word is <em><b>Unique</b></em>. This means that every password you have will need to be different for every account. You should never reuse a password. This is because if your one password gets compromised, then every account that uses that password is also compromised. Hackers often use a technique called <em><b>Credential Stuffing</b></em>. This technique is when a username and password combo get leaked from one source, they will try that account/password combination for other commonly used applications, such as Amazon, Google, Banks, etc. The easiest way to avoid credential stuffing is simply to always use a unique password for every account.</p>
                    <p>The second noted word is <em><b>Strong</b></em>. A strong password is a password that created so that ity secure against the password being <em><b>Brute Forced</b></em> or found in a hackers <em><b>Rainbow Table</b></em>. When creating a password typically a set of rules show saying that the password must contain an upper case character, a lower case character, a number, and a symbol. These rules are to help you not get caught in a brute force or rainbow table attack; however, following these recommendations don't alway leave you safe. For example 'Password1!' follows all the rules I mentioned, but it is a horrible password. To understand why, we must have a basic idea of how brute force and rainbow table attacks work.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Brute Force Attacks</h4>
                            <p>A brute force attack is where the attacker has an account name, but doesn't have the password. They will utilize a program that will go individually and try to force every single possible combination of passwords. Most times programs have inbuilt ways to thwart these attacks by locking an account after a certain number of log in attempts. However, if this was not there we could think of how many tries this would take.
                                <br>
                            There are 26 characters in the alphabet, so if a password was 2 character and case didn't matter then there are 26 to 2nd power of possibile passwords (676 possible passwords). This may seem like a lot of possibilities, but because our computers are really fast, that would only take a fraction of a second for a modern password cracker to get through. This is where case sensitivity helps, since we have 26 characters in the alphabet upper and lower case are 62 different characters. Now add in the numbers 0 - 9, so another 10 is 72 and then on top of that add as many special characters are allowed. 72 to the 2nd power is  5,184 possibilites. This is better, but still not enough. You will often see when creating a password that there is a range of how many characters the application will allow your password to be, best practice will be to use every single allowable character. As you can see the longer the password the safer, the shorter the easier to crack. If there is not a limit, think of a long phrase you remember and add a number and a symbol to it. If it is over 12 characters, you will be pretty safe.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Raindbow Table (Dictionary) Attacks</h4>
                            <p>This type of attack is a lot more common than brute force. This method doesn't require the attacker to constantly try to log in. This attack is done in multiple steps as a hacker will break into a companies system and steal the passwords of the users from the server. Lucky for you, if the service is reputable then the passwords are only stored in a <em><b>Hashed</b></em> format. The hased format is the output of the password once it has been encrypted. So when you log in, what actaully happens is that an algorithm will encrypt your password. The algorithm encryption techinique ensures that every hash is unique and it is also nearly impossible to recreate the password from the hashed password due to how the algorithm works. The hacker can know exactly how the algorithm works and yet it would still be almost impossible to recreate the password due to the complexity of the calculations. It is not important to know more than that for the beginner, only that a hacker would need super computers that even most government agencies could not afford to reverse engineer a password.
                            <br>
                            What the hacker does have though, is what is called a <em><b>Rainbow Table or Dictionary</b></em>. This is just a file that maps known passwords to the hashed equivalents. So they can use this to find a password via a hash if it is on the table. Typically these tables include commonly used passwords (hence 'Password1!') or passwords that have previously been cracked. This is why strong passwords will not use common words as their password. The user should create either a long phrase (known as a passphrase) or a completely random set of characters that have zero meaning at all.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So we now see that a password should be long, consist of a variety of characters of both cases/numbers/symbols, and be unique for every account. This is not an easy feat by any means as remembering all of these for every account seems impossible. This is why so many people reuse passwords, it is very easy to remember 1 password, but when you have more accounts than you can remember it is impossible to remember a password for all of them. This is where a password manager will make your life easier.</p>
                    <h3>Password Managers</h3>
                    <p>A password manager can be thought of as a vault where you store all your passwords. This will require a single password to sign in and inside the vault is storage for all of your account passwords. As such this, this must be an incredibly safe application. You will only need to remember this one password to have access to all others, so ensure it is unique and strong. There  are many password managers. Some are only locally saved to your computer and others are cloud based using very strong encryption and often another tool we will discuss called <em><b>Two Factor Authentification</b></em>. There will be suggestions for different password managers on the <a href="tools.html">Tools</a> page. Please look through and decide which works best.</p>
                    <p>Next we will discuss how to make your computer more safe and secure from malware and hackers!</p>
