                    <p>For almost any windows user, there is no reason to leave any security setting off. If a program is asking you to turn off any of these settings, you should be more concerned about what that program is doing and most likely not use the program at all.</p>
                    <p>By enabling all of these settings, your computer will block most harmful programs and warn you prior to you opening or running a program that may cause harm to you and your system. Always be sure that you are confident that the program you are running is legitimate before bypassing the Windows warning.</p>
                    <h3>How To Find Safe Programs</h3>
                    <p>The Microsoft Store comes default on Windows 11 computers. The software in this "store" is vetted by Microsoft and can be set to update automatically. Despite being called a store, this is actually a software repository and many of the programs in there are free. These programs are typically safe and since they are updated automatically, they get security updates without you needing to manually update every program.</p>
                    <p>When possible download all of programs from the Microsoft Store for the best protection. When the software is unavailable via the store, you may need to download this off the web. We will discuss Online Security in another section.</p>
